## Navigation

### Navbar
- The navigation bar features a centered menu for desktop views using `position-absolute` and `translate-middle-x`.
- Mobile navigation uses a collapsible menu that appears when the hamburger icon is clicked.
- Navbar items have a gradient hover effect that transitions smoothly.
- Active page is highlighted with a gradient underline.

### Footer
- The footer is positioned at the bottom of the page using flexbox.
- Contains links to important pages and copyright information.
- Styled differently based on the current theme.

## Theme System

### Theme Toggle
- Users can switch between dark and light modes using the moon/sun icon in the navbar.
- Theme preference is saved in localStorage and persists between visits.
- Theme transitions are smooth with a 300ms transition time.

### Theme CSS Variables
The application uses CSS variables to manage theme colors:

**Dark Theme (Default):**
```css
--primary-color: #7E57C2; /* Main purple */
--primary-light: #9575CD; /* Lighter purple */
--primary-dark: #5E35B1; /* Darker purple */
--secondary-color: #B39DDB; /* Accent purple */
--text-light: #F3E5F5; /* Light text for dark background */
--dark-bg: #1A1A2E; /* Dark blue-purple background */
--dark-bg-lighter: #2D2D42; /* Slightly lighter dark background */
```

**Light Theme:**
```css
--primary-color: #9575CD; /* Main purple (lighter) */
--primary-light: #B39DDB; /* Even lighter purple */
--primary-dark: #7E57C2; /* Darker purple */
--secondary-color: #5E35B1; /* Accent color */
--text-light: #311B92; /* Dark purple text for light background */
--dark-bg: #F5F5FC; /* Very light purple background */
--dark-bg-lighter: #E8E4F3; /* Light purple background */
```

### Theme Implementation
- Theme colors are applied using the `[data-theme="light"]` attribute selector.
- JavaScript toggles between themes by adding/removing this attribute.
- Special handling is provided for Bootstrap components.

## Components

### Buttons
The application uses several button styles:

1. **Primary Button (`btn-primary`)**: 
   - Used for main actions
   - Features a purple gradient background
   - Has a hover effect with slight elevation

2. **Gradient Button (`btn-gradient`)**:
   - Used for call-to-action buttons
   - Features a pink-to-purple gradient
   - Has a shimmer animation on hover

3. **Outline Button (`btn-outline-custom`)**:
   - Used for secondary actions
   - Has a border that matches the theme
   - Transitions to gradient background on hover

### Cards
- Cards use theme-specific background colors and borders.
- Feature cards have a subtle hover animation (translateY + shadow).
- Content cards have proper padding and consistent typography.

### Chat Interface
- The chat interface is split-screen: PDF viewer on the left, chat on the right.
- Messages are clearly distinguished between user and assistant.
- Input area is fixed at the bottom for easy access.

## Animations

### Page Transitions
- Pages fade in when loaded with a subtle upward movement.
- Internal navigation has a smooth fade-out/fade-in transition.
- Transition timing is kept short (300ms) to maintain responsiveness.

### Hover Effects
- Interactive elements have smooth hover transitions (300ms).
- Gradient effects use background-position or opacity changes rather than color changes.
- Buttons have subtle transform effects to indicate interactivity.

## Responsive Design

### Mobile First Approach
- The layout adapts fluidly to different screen sizes.
- On small screens, the navigation collapses into a hamburger menu.
- Typography scales appropriately for readability.

### Breakpoints
- The application uses the following breakpoints:
  - Small: < 576px (Mobile phones)
  - Medium: 576px - 767px (Large phones/Small tablets)
  - Large: 768px - 991px (Tablets)
  - Extra Large: 992px+ (Desktops)

### Component Adaptations
- The PDF viewer and chat interface stack vertically on mobile devices.
- Hero section on the landing page adjusts content positioning for smaller screens.
- Feature cards display in a single column on mobile.

## CSS Architecture

### File Structure
- `style.css`: Core styles and global components
- `landing.css`: Landing page specific styles
- Component-specific styles are included in the main stylesheet

### CSS Variables
- Uses CSS custom properties for theming
- Gradient definitions are stored as variables
- Spacing and typography follow a consistent system

### Utility Classes
Several utility classes are available:
- `.theme-transition`: For elements that should transition during theme changes
- `.btn-gradient`: For gradient-styled buttons
- `.page-transition`: For elements that should animate during page load

## Best Practices

1. **Theme Consistency**: All components respect the current theme.
2. **Performance**: Transitions and animations are optimized for performance.
3. **Accessibility**: Color contrasts meet WCAG standards.
4. **Code Organization**: CSS is organized by component and function.
5. **Responsive Testing**: All pages are tested across device sizes.
